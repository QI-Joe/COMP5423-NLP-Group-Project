This involves determining what you want to achieve, why you want to achieve it, and how you plan to do so. \n\nTo do this, start by brainstorming and breaking down your overall goal into smaller, more specific objectives that are measurable and achievable. Consider what resources you will need, any potential challenges or obstacles, and the timeline for completion. \n\nIt's also helpful to involve any stakeholders or team members in this process to ensure everyone is on the same page and working towards the same end goal. By clearly defining your goals and objectives in the beginning, you are setting yourself up for success and creating a roadmap for the rest of the project."
